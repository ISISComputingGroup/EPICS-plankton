# Contributing to Plankton

## How to contribute
Contributions to Plankton are always welcome and there are different ways of contributing to the framework. Problems, bugs and questions should be opened as [issues](https://github.com/DMSC-Instrument-Data/plankton/issues), this is a very good way of keeping track of how Plankton has developed over time and also for others to see if similar issues have been raised in the past.

Another way to contribute is by writing a new device simulator. The following section describes how to do that, what to consider, and how to get the changes upstream.

## Writing a new device simulator

The Plankton framework provides all the infrastructure to run device simulations so that developing a new simulation requires little more than writing code for the actual device. Currently, adding a new device requires the code from the github repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/DMSC-Instrument-Data/plankton
```

The process of writing a new device simulator is best explained using the example of a stateful device.

### Device analysis

The hypothetical device that is to be simulated is a simple controller that controls one motor and can be communicated with via a [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) connection. The user can connect to the device using telnet and submit commands followed by `\r\n` (automatically added by [telnet](https://linux.die.net/man/1/telnet)). Responses are followed by `\r\n` as well. The following commands and responses are available:

 * `S?`: Returns the status of the motor connected to the controller. Can be either `idle` or `moving`, is initially `idle`.
 * `P?`: Returns the current position of the motor in mm. Is initially 0.
 * `T=10.0`: Sets the target position to `10.0` (accepts any floating point number) and starts a movement if the position is within the limits [0, 250] and returns `T=10.0`. If the motor is not in idle state, it returns `err: not idle`. If the value violates the limits, it returns `err: not 0<=T<=250`.
 * `T?` Returns the current target of the motor in mm. Is initially 0.
 * `H`: Stops the movement by setting the target to the current position and returns `T=6.555,P=6.555`. If the motor is idle, nothing happens, but the values are returned anyway.

In the simplest approach, the parameters that can describe the device are:

 * position: Read only.
 * target: Can be read and written by the user, but with certain restrictions.

Additionally, the device is stateful in the sense that it can be in one of three states.

 * `idle`: The motor is powered on and ready to receive commands.
 * `moving`: The motor is moving towards the user supplied target.

Between those three states, different transitions exist:

 * `idle` -> `moving`: The target position is different from the current position, the motor starts moving.
 * `moving` -> `idle`: The motor has reached the target position or the user has supplied a stop command, which sets the target position to the current position, causing the motor to stop.

The states and transitions described above form a finite state machine with two states and two transitions. This state machine forms the heart of the simulated device, so it should be implemented using Plankton's cycle based [finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine), which will be explained below.

### Implementing the device simulation

Each device resides in its own sub-package in the `devices`-package. The first step is to create a new directory in the [devices](../devices) directory called `example_motor`, which should contain a single file, `__init__.py`. For simple devices like this it's acceptable to put everything into one file, but for more complex simulators it's recommended to follow the structure of the devices that are already part of the Plankton distribution.

Conceptually, in Plankton, devices are split in two Parts: a device model, which contains internal device state, as well as potentially a state machine, and an interface that exposes the device to the outside world via a communication protocol that is provided by an "adapter". The adapter specifies the communication protocol (for example [EPICS](http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/) or TCP/IP), whereas the interface specifies the syntax and semantics of the actual command language of the device.

For the actual device simulation there are two classes to choose between for sub-classing. The class `Device` can be used for very simple devices that do not require a state machine to represent their operation. On each simulation cycle, the method `doProcess` is executed if it is implemented. This can be used to implement time-dependent behavior. For the majority of cases, such as in the example, it is more convenient to inherit from `StateMachineDevice`. It provides an internal state machine and options to override characteristics of the state machine on initialization.

`StateMachineDevice` has three methods that must be implemented by sub-classes: `_get_state_handlers`, `_get_initial_state` and `_get_transition_handlers`. They are used to define the state machine. A fourth, optional method can be used to initialize internal device state, it's calld `_initialize_data`. In this case the device implementation should also go into `__init__.py`:

```python
from devices import StateMachineDevice

from core.statemachine import State
from core import approaches

from collections import OrderedDict

class DefaultMovingState(State):
    def in_state(self, dt):
        self._context.position = approaches.linear(self._context.position, self._context.target,
                                                   self._context.speed, dt)


class SimulatedExampleMotor(StateMachineDevice):
    def _initialize_data(self):
        self.position = 0.0
        self._target = 0.0
        self.speed = 2.0

    def _get_state_handlers(self):
        return {
            'idle': State(),
            'moving': DefaultMovingState()
        }

    def _get_initial_state(self):
        return 'idle'

    def _get_transition_handlers(self):
        return OrderedDict([
            (('idle', 'moving'), lambda: self.position != self.target),
            (('moving', 'idle'), lambda: self.position == self.target)])

    @property
    def state(self):
        return self._csm.state

    @property
    def target(self):
        return self._target

    @target.setter
    def target(self, new_target):
        if self.state == 'moving':
            raise RuntimeError('Can not set new target while moving.')

        if not (0 <= new_target <= 250):
            raise ValueError('Target is out of range [0, 250]')

        self._target = new_target

    def stop(self):
        self._target = self.position

        return self.target, self.position
```

This defines the state machine according to the description at the top of the page and some internal state variables, for example `target`, which has some limits on when and to what values it can be set.

Both states of the motor are described by a state handler. In case of the `idle`-state it is enough to use `State`, which simply does nothing. The `State`-class has three methods that can be overridden: `on_entry`, `in_state` and `on_exit`. For other ways to specify those state handlers, please consult the documentation of `StateMachine`, where this is described in detail. The advantage of using the `State`-class is that it has a so called context, which is stored in the `_context`-member. In case of `StateMachineDevice`, this context is the device object. This means that device data can be modified in a state handler.

This is the case for the `moving`-state, where a state handler has been defined by sub-classing `State`. In its `in_state`-method it modifies the `position` member of the device until it has reached `target` with a rate that is stored in the `speed`-member. This linear change behavior is implemented in the `linear`-function from `core.approaches`. It automatically makes sure that the target is always obtained even for very coarse `dt`-values.

The transitions between states are defined using lambda-functions in this case, which simply check whether the current position is identical with the target or not.

The device also provides a read-only property `state`, which forwards the state machine's (in the device as member `_csm`) state. The speed of the motor is not part of the device specification, but it is added as a member so that it can be changed via the `control.py` script to test how the motor behaves at different speeds. The device is now fully functional, but it's not possible to interact with it yet, because the interface is not specified yet.

### Implementing the device interface

Device interfaces are implemented by sub-classing an appropriate pre-written communication adapter base class from the framework's `adapters`-package and overriding a few members. In this case this adapter is called `StreamAdapter`. The first step is to specify the available commands in terms of a collection of `Cmd`-objects. These objects effectively bind commands specified in terms of regular expressions to a the adapter's methods. According to the specifications above, the commands are defined like this:

```python
from adapters.stream import StreamAdapter, Cmd

class ExampleMotorStreamInterface(StreamAdapter):
    commands = {
        Cmd('get_status', r'^S\?$'),
        Cmd('get_position', r'^P\?$'),
        Cmd('get_target', r'^T\?$'),
        Cmd('set_target', r'^T=([-+]?[0-9]*\.?[0-9]+)$', argument_mappings=(float,)),
        Cmd('stop', r'^H$',
            return_mapping=lambda x: 'T={},P={}'.format(x[0], x[1])),
    }

    in_terminator = '\r\n'
    out_terminator = '\r\n'

    def get_status(self):
        return self._device.state

    def get_position(self):
        return self._device.position

    def get_target(self):
        return self._device.target

    def set_target(self, new_target):
        try:
            self._device.target = new_target
            return 'T={}'.format(new_target)
        except RuntimeError:
            return 'err: not idle'
        except ValueError:
            return 'err: not 0<=T<=250'
```

The first argument to `Cmd` specifies the method name the command is bound to, whereas the second argument is the regular expression that a request coming in over the TCP stream must match. If a method has arguments (such as `set_target`), these need to be defined as capture groups in the regular expression. These groups are passed as strings to the bound method. If any sort of conversion is required for these arguments, the `argument_mapping`-parameter can be a tuple of conversion functions with the same lengths as the number of capture groups in the regular expression. In the case of `set_target` it's enough to convert the string to float. Return values (except `None`) are converted to strings automatically, but this conversion can be overridden by supplying a callable object to `return_mapping`, as it is the case for the `stop`-command.

You may have noticed that `stop` is not a method of the interface. `StreamAdapter` tries to resolve the supplied method names in multiple ways. First it checks its own members, then it checks the members of the device it owns (accessible in the interface via the `_device`-member) and adds forwarders to itself if possible. If the method name can not be found in either the device or the adapter, an error is produced, which minimizes the likelihood of typos. The definitions in the interface always have precedence, this is intentionally done so that device behavior can be overridden later on with minimal changes to the code.

In case of the `stop`-method, which returns two floating point numbers (target and position), the `return_mapping` is used to format the device's position and target as specified in the protocol definition at the top of the page.

Finally, in- and out-terminators need to be specified. These are stripped from and appended to requests and replies respectively.

This entire device can be found in the `examples` directory. It can be started using the `-k` parameter of `plankton.py`:

```
$ ./plankton.py -k examples example_motor -- -b 127.0.0.1 -p 9999
```

All functionality described in the [Readme](https://github.com/DMSC-Instrument-Data/plankton), such as accessing the device and the simulation via the `control.py`-script are automatically available.

### Unit tests

Unit tests should be added to the `test`-directory. While it would be best to have unit tests for device and interface separately, it is most important that the tests capture overall device behavior, so that it's immediately noticed when a change to Plankton's core parts breaks the simulation. It also makes it easier later on to refactor and change the device.

### Adding setups

In order to test certain failure scenarios of a device, setups can be added to a device. The easiest way is to define a dictionary called `setups` in the `__init__.py` file. A setup consists of a device type and initialization parameters:

```python
setups = dict(
    moving=dict(
        device_type=SimulatedExampleMotor,
        parameters=dict(
            override_initial_state='moving',
            override_initial_data=dict(
                _target=120.0, position=20.0
            )
        )
    )
)
```

In this case a `moving`-scenario is defined where the motor is already moving to a target when the simulation is started.

## Further steps

Once a device is developed far enough, it's time to submit a pull request. As an external contributor, this happens via a fork on github. Members of the development team will review the code and may make suggestions for changes. Once the code is acceptable, it will be merged into Plankton's master branch and become a part of the distribution.

If a second interface is added to a device, either using a different adapter or the same adapter but with different commands, the interface definitions should be moved out of the `__init__.py` file. Plankton will continue to work if the interfaces are moved to a sub-folder of the device called `interfaces`. This needs to have its own `__init__.py`, where interface-classes can be imported from other files in that module. It's best to look at the chopper and linkam_t95 devices that are already in Plankton.

The same is true for setups. For complex setups, these should be moved to a sub-module of the device called `setups`, where each setup can live in its own file. Please see the documentation of `devices.import_device` for reference.

For initial experiments it's also possible to develop a device outside of Planton's source tree. Assuming the device package is called `my_devices`, which is a subdirectory in `/some/arbitrary/path`:

```
/some/arbitrary/path
    |
    +- my_devices
        |
        +- device_1
        |
        +- device_2
        |
        +- __init__.py
```

These devices can be started from within the Plankton directory by:

```
$ ./plankton.py -a /some/arbitrary/path -k my_devices device_1
```
