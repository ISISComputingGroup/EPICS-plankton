    This class exists mainly for consistency. It is meant to implement very simple devices that
    do not require a state machine for their simulation. For such devices, all that is required
    is subclassing from `Device` and possibly implementing `doProcess`, but this is optional.

    StateMachineDevice offers more functionality and is more likely to be useful for implementing
    simulations of real devices.

        """
        This class is intended to be sub-classed to implement devices using a finite state machine
        internally.

        Implementing such a device is straightforward, there are three methods that *must* be overriden:

            `_get_state_handlers`
            `_get_initial_state`
            `_get_transition_handlers`

        The first method is supposed to return a dictionary with state handlers for each state
        of the state machine, the second method must return the name of the initial state.
        The third method must return a dict-like object (often an OrderedDict from collections)
        that defines the conditions for transitions between the states of the state machine.

        They are implemented as methods and not as plain class member variables, because often
        they use the `self`-variable, which does not exist at the class level.

        From these three methods, a `StateMachine`-instance is constructed, it's available as
        the device's `_csm`-member. CSM is short for "cycle-based state machine".

        Most device implementation will also want to override this method:

            `_initialize_data`

        This method should initialise device state variables (such as temperature, speed, etc.). Having
        this in a separate method from `__init__` has the advantage that it can be used to reset those
        variables at a later stage, without having to write the same code again.

        Following this scheme, inheriting from `StateMachineDevice` also provides the possibility
        for users of the class to override the states, the transitions, the initial state and
        even the data. For states, transitions and data, dicts need to be passed to the constructor,
        for the initial state that should be a string.

        All these overrides can be used to define device setups to describe certain scenarios more easily.

        :param override_states: Dict with one entry per state. Only states defined in the state machine are allowed.
        :param override_transitions: Dict with (state, state) tuples as keys and callables as values.

    This function tries to load a given device with a given setup from the package specified
    in the device_package parameter. First it checks if there is a module

        device_package.device.setups.setup

    and tries to import two members from that module `device_type` and `parameters`. The former
    must be the device class and the latter the parameters that are passed to the class' constructor.
    The above mentioned module might look like this:

        from ..device import SomeDeviceClass as device_type

        parameters = dict(device_param1='some_value', device_param2=3.4)

    This allows for a large degree of freedom for specifying setups. If that is not required,
    and the setup does not exist in that sub-module of the device, this function checks for a dictionary
    named `setups` directly in the device module (device_package.device). So the device_package.device.__init__.py
    could contain something like this:

        from .device import SomeDeviceClass

        setups = dict(
                     default=dict(

    the first sub-class of `CanProcess` that it finds in the device module. That means in the simplest case,
    the __init__.py only needs to declare a class that can be instantiated without parameters.

    If all of that fails, an exception is raised.

    Otherwise, a device type and the parameter-dict for object instantiation are returned.
