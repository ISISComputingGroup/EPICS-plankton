        """
        ExposedObject is a class that makes it easy to expose an object via the JSONRPCResponseManager
        from the json-rpc package, where it can serve as a dispatcher. For this purpose it exposes
        a read-only dict-like interface.

        The basic problem solved by this wrapper is that plain data members of an object are not
        really captured well by the RPC-approach, where a client performs function calls on a
        remote machine and gets the result back.

        The supplied object is inspected using dir(object) and all entries that do not start
        with a _ are exposed in a way that depends on whether the corresponding member
        is a method or a property (either in the Python-sense or the general OO-sense). Methods
        are stored directly, and stored in an internal dict where the method name is the key and the
        callable method object is the value. For properties, a getter- and a setter function
        are generated, which are then stored in the same dict. The names of these methods for
        a property called 'a' are 'a:get' and 'a:set'. The separator has been chosen to be
        colon because it can't be part of a valid Python identifier.

        If the second argument is not empty, it is interpreted to be the list of members
        to expose and only those are actually exposed. This can be used to explicitly expose
        members of an object that start with an underscore. If all but one or two members
        should be exposed, it's also possible to use the exclude-argument to explicitly
        exclude a few members. Both parameters can be used in combination, the exclude-list
        takes precedence.

        :param object: The object to expose.
        :param members: If supplied, only this list of methods will be exposed.
